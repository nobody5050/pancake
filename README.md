# Pancake Wiki
On this repo you will find many important things in Wiki section, such as: tutorials, general info and documentation! I also might post info about jams made with pancake (if such a thing would ever exist)

So come along and stay on this site if you want to learn about pancake library and how to use it!

If you're completely new, jump to Getting Started Section

If you've already read this articule, you can explore docs of pancake and create your very own game. Have fun!
